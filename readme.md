### Profile Description
| Abbreviation | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Single | Extruder/Tool Zero (T0) uses the specified material |
| Dual | Great for two-color prints - Both extruders (T0 and T1) use the same type of material |
| BVOH | T0 uses the material specified and T1 uses BVOH support material |
| Dupl. | Both extruders can be used in duplication mode to print two copies of the same object at once |
| Vase | Vase mode - only a single outer layer of the object is printed |
| Fast | Faster print time than the stock profile, with some sacrifice in quality |
